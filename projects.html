                    <p>Alpha is an autonomous maze-solving robot inspired by the renowned "Micro-mouse" 
                        competition. In this competition, small robotic mice autonomously navigate through a 
                        maze to find the shortest path from a designated starting point to the center of the maze.

                    <h2>3. Increasing Efficiency of Rankine Cycle</h2>
                    <p>The Rankine Cycle is a thermodynamic model consisting of four stages: compression, heat 
                        addition, expansion, and heat rejection. It illustrates the transformation of water into 
                        steam to generate power. The cycle begins with water compression, followed by isobaric 
                        heating in a boiler, expansion through a turbine, and concludes with isobaric heat 
                        rejection in a condenser. While idealized, the Rankine cycle provides fundamental 
                        insights into the efficiency of steam-based power systems, guiding the analysis and 
                        optimization of practical applications.</p>

                    <h2>4. Transient Heat Analysis of Car Brake System</h2>
                    <p>This project focuses on understanding the thermal behaviour of a car's brake system during 
                        braking events. The project aims to simulate and analyze how heat is distributed and 
                        dissipated within the brake components over time. It utilizes Numerical Methods 
                        (Finite Difference Method) and Computational Modelling to gain insights into the Transient 
                        Thermal Dynamics of the brake system. It also discusses the Non-Dimensionalization of the 
                        governing equations to simplify the analysis.</p>

                    <h2>5. Flex Gloves - Bridging Communication Gaps with Technology</h2>
                    <p>This project was done in the course of World of Engineering. We developed innovative 
                        Flex Gloves designed to bridge the communication gap for individuals with speech 
                        impairments. These gloves are equipped with flex sensors and motion detectors that capture 
                        the movements of sign language gestures. The data is then processed through a 
                        microcontroller, which translates these gestures into audible speech via a connected 
                        speaker.</p>
                        <p> Through Flex Gloves, we aim to provide a voice to those who communicate through sign language, 
                            fostering greater understanding and interaction in diverse social settings.</p>
